This package was created by researchers from the `WE3 Lab <https://we3lab.stanford.edu/>`_ at Stanford University to assist in their energy-water nexus research. 
The goal was to address the complexity of computing the electricity bill of an industrial consumer while evaluating the cost-minimizing energy management strategies for water systems, 
such as wastewater treatment plants [`Musabendesu |j-cleaner-prod| (2021) <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.124454>`_; `Bolorinos *Environ. Sci. Technol.* (2023) <https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.3c00365>`_; `Chapin *Environ. Sci. Technol.* (2025) <https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c09773>`_],
desalination facilities [`Rao *ACS Sustainable Chem. Eng.* (2024) <https://doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.4c06353>`_],
and water distribution [`Rao *Nat. Water* (2024) <https://doi.org/10.1038/s44221-024-00316-4>`_].



Paragraph 2: Tariffs are nonlinear (demand charges) and surprisingly difficult to calculate [`Chapin *Nat. Sci. Data* (2024) <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-023-02886-6>`_]

Paragraph 3: However, there are numerous other applications [cite examples]
